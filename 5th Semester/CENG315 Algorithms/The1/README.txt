int sillySort(int* arr, long &comparison, long & swap, int size);

int crossMergeSort(int *arr, long &comparison, int size);


You are asked to complete the function definitions to sort the given array $arr$ with ascending order.

sillySort() should count the number of $comparison$ and $swap$ executed during sorting proccess (Comparisons are only between the values to be sorted only, not your auxiliary comparisons) and return the number of calls of sillySort() (which is 1 in minimum).
crossMergeSort() should count the number of $comparison$ executed during sorting proccess (Comparisons are only between the values to be sorted only, not your auxiliary comparisons) and return the number of calls of crossMergeSort() (which is 1 in minimum).

Silly sorting algortihm (sillySort()) is as follows:
assume the input array A[1..N] is divided into 4 quarters as q1=A[1..N/4], q2=A[N/4+1..N/2], q3=A[N/2+1..3N/4], q4=A[3N/4+1..N]
do 6 recursive calls as follows when N>=4 otherwise sort the list with N<4 elements directly.
sillysort: q1 and q2 (sillysort A[1..N/2] )
sillysort: q2 and q3 (sillysort A[N/4+1..3N/4] )
sillysort: q3 and q4 (sillysort A[N/2+1..N] )
sillysort: q1 and q2
sillysort: q2 and q3
sillysort: q1 and q2
when the input size  N<=2 no recursion. (do nothing for N=0 or 1 and just apply swap when N =2)
to make things simpler we will only use N as a power of 2 on our tests (although not necessary with non-rec termination conditions).
It is an in-place algorithm, so no merging is needed. Nothing else is needed after the recursive calls.
count the swap between any 2 elements of the array A, such as swapping A[i] and A[j].
count the comparison between any 2 elements of the array A, such as A[i]>A[j]
return the total number of calls to sillySort()


Cross merge sort (crossMergeSort()) is a variation of k-way merge sort, where k is 4 and the partitions are merged in a different order:

Assume the input array has N elements which is a power of 2. If the input array A[1..N] has more than or equal to 4 elements it is divied into 4 quarters as q1=A[1..N/4], q2=A[N/4+1..N/2], q3=A[N/2+1..3N/4], q4=A[3N/4+1..N]
do 4 recursive calls as follows:
cross merge sort q1
cross merge sort q2
cross merge sort q3
cross merge sort q4
Then,
merge q1 and q3 into h1
merge q2 and q4 into h2
merge h1 and h2 into resulting array

If the input array has exactly 2 elements, just compare these elements and swap if necessary.
If the input array has exactly 1 element, do nothing.
